	abstract = {We designed a compact, low-loss and wavelength insensitive Y-junction for submicron silicon waveguide using finite difference time-domain ({FDTD}) simulation and particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), and fabricated the device in a 248 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS}) compatible process. Measured average insertion loss is 0.28 ± 0.02 {dB}, uniform across an 8-inch wafer. The device footprint is less than 1.2 μm x 2 μm, an order of magnitude smaller than typical multimode interferometers ({MMIs}) and directional couplers.},

Here, we outline a cross-section of key developments in this emerging field of photonic optimization: moving from a recap of foundational results to motivation of applications in nonlinear, topological, near-field and on-chip optics.},
