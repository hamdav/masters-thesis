	abstract = {We designed a compact, low-loss and wavelength insensitive Y-junction for submicron silicon waveguide using finite difference time-domain ({FDTD}) simulation and particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), and fabricated the device in a 248 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS}) compatible process. Measured average insertion loss is 0.28 ± 0.02 {dB}, uniform across an 8-inch wafer. The device footprint is less than 1.2 μm x 2 μm, an order of magnitude smaller than typical multimode interferometers ({MMIs}) and directional couplers.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2303.18091},
	abstract = {Optomechanical crystals ({OMCs}) are a promising and versatile platform for transduction between mechanical and optical fields. However, the release from the substrate used in conventional suspended {OMCs} also prevents heat-carrying noise phonons from rapidly leaking away. Thermal anchoring may be improved by attaching the {OMCs} directly to the substrate. Previous work towards such clamped, i.e. non-suspended, {OMCs} suffers from weak interaction rates and insufficient lifetimes. Here, we present a new class of clamped {OMCs} realizing -- for the first time -- optomechanical interactions in the resolved-sideband regime required for quantum transduction. Our approach leverages high-wavevector mechanical modes outside the continuum. We observe a record zero-point optomechanical coupling rate of \$g\_0/(2{\textbackslash}pi) {\textbackslash}approx 0.50\$ {MHz} along with a sevenfold improvement in the single-photon cooperativity of clamped {OMCs}. Our devices operate at frequencies commonly used in superconducting qubits. This opens a new avenue using clamped {OMCs} in both classical and quantum communications, sensing, and computation through scalable mechanical circuitry that couples strongly to light.},

This paper presents an introduction to the subject, emphasising the simplicity of the ideas when viewed in the context of linear algebra. Detailed discussions also include the extension to p.d.e.'s, the construction of the adjoint p.d.e. and its boundary conditions, and the physical significance of the adjoint solution. The paper concludes with examples of the use of adjoint methods for optimising the design of business jets.},
