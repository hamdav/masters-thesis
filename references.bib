	abstract = {Optomechanical crystals ({OMCs}) are a promising and versatile platform for transduction between mechanical and optical fields. However, the release from the substrate used in conventional suspended {OMCs} also prevents heat-carrying noise phonons from rapidly leaking away. Thermal anchoring may be improved by attaching the {OMCs} directly to the substrate. Previous work towards such clamped, i.e. non-suspended, {OMCs} suffers from weak interaction rates and insufficient lifetimes. Here, we present a new class of clamped {OMCs} realizing -- for the first time -- optomechanical interactions in the resolved-sideband regime required for quantum transduction. Our approach leverages high-wavevector mechanical modes outside the continuum. We observe a record zero-point optomechanical coupling rate of \$g\_0/(2{\textbackslash}pi) {\textbackslash}approx 0.50\$ {MHz} along with a sevenfold improvement in the single-photon cooperativity of clamped {OMCs}. Our devices operate at frequencies commonly used in superconducting qubits. This opens a new avenue using clamped {OMCs} in both classical and quantum communications, sensing, and computation through scalable mechanical circuitry that couples strongly to light.},

In this article, we provide a complete demonstration of our recently proposed inverse design technique, wherein the user specifies design constraints in the form of target fields rather than a dielectric constant profile, and in particular we use this method to demonstrate a new demultiplexing grating. The novel grating, which has not been developed using conventional techniques, accepts a vertical-incident Gaussian beam from a free-space and separates O-band \$(1300{\textbackslash}mathrm\{nm\})\$ and C-band \$(1550{\textbackslash}mathrm\{nm\})\$ light into separate waveguides.

	abstract = {Radio-frequency communication systems have long used bulk- and surface-acoustic-wave devices supporting ultrasonic mechanical waves to manipulate and sense signals. These devices have greatly improved our ability to process microwaves by interfacing them to orders-of-magnitude slower and lower-loss mechanical fields. In parallel, long-distance communications have been dominated by low-loss infrared optical photons. As electrical signal processing and transmission approach physical limits imposed by energy dissipation, optical links are now being actively considered for mobile and cloud technologies. Thus there is a strong driver for wavelength-scale mechanical wave or \&\#x201C;phononic\&\#x201D; circuitry fabricated by scalable semiconductor processes. With the advent of these circuits, new micro- and nanostructures that combine electrical, optical, and mechanical elements have emerged. In these devices, such as optomechanical waveguides and resonators, optical photons and gigahertz phonons are ideally matched to one another, as both have wavelengths on the order of micrometers. The development of phononic circuits has thus emerged as a vibrant field of research pursued for optical signal processing and sensing applications as well as emerging quantum technologies. In this review, we discuss the key physics and figures of merit underpinning this field. We also summarize the state of the art in nanoscale electro- and optomechanical systems with a focus on scalable platforms such as silicon. Finally, we give perspectives on what these new systems may bring and what challenges they face in the coming years. In particular, we believe hybrid electro- and optomechanical devices incorporating highly coherent and compact mechanical elements on a chip have significant untapped potential for electro-optic modulation, quantum microwave-to-optical photon conversion, sensing, and microwave signal processing.},

Predicting a band structure and designing topological structures with desirable characteristics have become a research hotspot. In this study, a data-driven deep learning framework is applied to arrive at the prediction of the band structure and the inverse design of topology. A convolutional neural network is trained to predict band structures of phononic crystals. After training a generative adversarial network, the generator is concatenated with the convolutional neural network for inverse design. Meanwhile, a complex band structure of phononic crystals is computed by the periodic spectral finite element method to present the spatial decay of evanescent waves. The topology with the greater spatial attenuation is screened from the ground truth topology and the inversely designed topology. Finally, an optimized topological phononic crystal with an anticipated bandgap is obtained, which has the potential for better acoustic insulation and vibration isolation.},

	abstract = {The quantum nature of an oscillating mechanical object is anything but apparent. The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have a well defined energy, but are quantum superpositions of equally spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different energy eigenstates using resolvable differences in the atom’s transition frequency. For photons, such dispersive measurements have been performed in cavity1,2 and circuit quantum electrodynamics3. Here we report an experiment in which an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts that are about five times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest experimental improvements, we expect that our approach will enable quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons4 and will lead to quantum sensors and information-processing approaches5 that use chip-scale nanomechanical devices.},

However, and perhaps due to this colloquial understanding, specific measurements on the curse of dimensionality and its effects are not as extensive. In continuous domains, the volume of the search space grows exponentially with dimensionality. Conversely, the number of function evaluations budgeted to explore this search space usually grows only linearly. The divergence of these growth rates has important effects on the parameters used in particle swarm optimization and differential evolution as dimensionality increases. New experiments focus on the effects of population size and key changes to the search characteristics of these popular metaheuristics when population size is less than the dimensionality of the search space. Results show how design guidelines developed for low-dimensional implementations can become unsuitable for high-dimensional search spaces.},

	abstract = {Topology optimization is a computational tool that can be used for the systematic design of photonic crystals, waveguides, resonators, filters and plasmonics. The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like fashion. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using mathematical programming-based optimization methods and analytical gradient calculations. The paper reviews the basic procedures behind topology optimization, a large number of applications ranging from photonic crystal design to surface plasmonic devices, and lists some of the future challenges in non-linear applications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature and trends on the design of periodic microstructural composite materials including photonic crystals ({PtCs}), phononic crystals ({PnCs}), and metamaterials ({MMs}) by topology optimization. The properties of these materials rely highly on the constitutive materials and their spatial distributions and the resulting materials may exhibit various special properties, for example, photonic/phononic band gaps, negative permittivity/permeability, negative effective modulus, and negative refraction. Therefore, {PtCs}, {PnCs}, and {MMs} can be viewed as structural materials with periodic unit cells, the design of which is a typical topology optimization problem for desired properties or functionalities. In recent years, a great amount of research has implemented topology optimization for designing these structural materials as well as the associated functional devices. This review summarizes the most recent development in topology optimization of {PtCs}, {PnCs}, and {MMs} and the possible directions for future research are recommended.},
