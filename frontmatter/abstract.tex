\section*{\abstractname}
Phononic devices could enable and improve a broad range of functions in
the realm of classical and quantum information processing.
However, such devices are currently often designed by hand, combined with brute force
parameter sweeps, which severely limits the designs that can be investigated.
This work presents a method for inverse-design of phononic devices,
allowing a vastly larger design space to be explored.
At the heart of the method lies a fast calculation of gradients using the
adjoint method, whereby the gradient computation costs no more than a single
normal simulation.
I show that this method is theoretically applicable to phononic devices,
and demonstrate that it works in simulation.
As a proof of concept, I attempt to design a phononic beamsplitter.
The design process consists of two steps:
one with continuously varying materials which is non-physical,
but easier to optimize;
and one with binary devices, accomplished through level-set methods.
The first step yielded near perfect performance, achieving less than one percent
reflection and almost nothing being scattered into other modes.
The second step never reached quite as good performance, though still a 45/45
split was obtained with less than 10 \% of the power reflected.
With some tweaking of the second step,
this method looks promising for use in the design of future phononic devices.
