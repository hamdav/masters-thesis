\section*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank the members of the Quantum Photonics
Laboratory for making this thesis project possible,
especially my supervisor and examiner RaphaÃ«l without whom the inverse design
concept would remain foreign to me.
I would also like to extend a special thank you to my supervisors Paul and Johan, for their valuable
discussions, comments and help in navigating the murky waters of COMSOL
documentation (have you checked the mesh?).
My opponent Ida deserves a big thank you for all of her acute comments and
concerns as well.
Finally, I am eternally grateful for the unwavering support and encouragement
from Johanna, and my fantastic friends and family.
