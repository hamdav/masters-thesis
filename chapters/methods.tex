\chapter{Methods}

The aim of this thesis is to use inverse design to find a phononic beamsplitter,
a task that can be divided into three parts: 
First, some definitions of what
should be designed and what constitutes a ``good'' design needs to be made.
Second, we need a way to calculate the gradient of the ``goodness'' with respect
to the design.
And lastly, we need a gradient based optimization algorithm to find the optimal
design.
All of this will be described in this chapter.

\section{Design}

The device design to be optimized can be seen in \cref{fig:bs-design}.
The input and output waveguides consists of unit cells like the one in
\cref{fig:unitcell}.
The values for the parameters in the sketch are given in \cref{tab:params}.
The reason for using this mode in this waveguide is that it has been shown to be
interesting for avoiding mechanical leakage into the substrate on which it is
clamped, as well as retaining a high optomechanical
coupling.\cite{kolvik_clamped_2023}

Inside the design area, there can be one of two kinds of designs.
The first is a \emph{continuous design}, meaning that the material parameters
$\rho$ and $C_{ijkl}$ are continuously varying. The range of values that they
can take are between the density and elasticity of pure silicon and that of air.
Any in-between values are obviously not something that can be physically
realized, but it is useful as a first step in the optimization.
The second kind is a binary design, where each point either has silicon or not
and there are no in-between values.
This is accomplished using level-set methods, which will be explained in
\cref{sec:level-set}.

Because the device is completely symmetric, only one half of it needs to be
modeled, and the other half is extrapolated with a symmetry boundary condition.

\subsection{Objective function}

The figure of merit of the device is how much of the input excitation gets transmitted
into the output beams.
Furthermore, all of the excitation of the output waveguide should be in the same
mode that was excited at the input.
Therefore, a mode overlap integral is used:
\begin{equation}
	I = \int_{\Omega_1} \vec{m}^*(\vec{x}) \vec{u}(\vec{x})
\end{equation}
where $\vec m$ is the shape of the mode (\cref{fig:ms1}).
Because the phase of the output waves does not matter,
the absolute value squared of the overlap integral is taken to be the objective
function,
\begin{equation}
	\fobj = \abs{I}^2 = I I^*
\end{equation}

The functional derivative of $\fobj$ with respect to $p$ then becomes
\begin{align}
	\diff.f.{\fobj}{p}(x) &= \diff.f.{I}{p}(x) I^* + I\diff.f.{I^*}{p}(x)\\
	&= \diff.f.{I}{p}(x) I^* + \left(I^*\diff.f.{I}{p}(x)\right)^*\\
	&= 2\Re\left(\diff.f.{I}{p}(x) I^*\right).
\end{align}
The derivative of $I$ was derived in \cref{sec:spec_der}.

\tododec{Paragraph about pure part of objective function, enforcing the minimum
feature size}

\subsection{Excitation}

In order to excite the input waveguide in the desired mode,
the stress on the boundary of a unit cell was exported from a unit cell
eigenmode simulation and applied to the boundary marked in red in
\cref{fig:bs-design}.
Since the frequency is perfectly controlled, this should excite only the desired
mode, since that is the only permitted mode close by as seen in the band diagram
in \cref{fig:banddiagram}.

In order to confirm that the excitation was indeed fully in the desired mode, a
separate model with only a waveguide with 200 unitcells was created.
Applying the excitation and running the simulation, the mode overlap integral
was then calculated, as well as the integral $\int u_i^* u_i$ from which one can
calculate the proportion of energy in the mode compared to the energy in other
modes.
The result was near perfect (>99.9\%) excitation of only the desired mode.

\subsection{Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs)}

Ideally, the input and outputs are infinite waveguides.
Unfortunately, it has been discovered that infinity is big; simulating
infinite waveguides would take infinite time, and the author would like to be done by
June.
Instead, \glspl{pml} are placed at the caps of the input and output waveguides.
The purpose of the \gls{pml} is to absorb any incoming waves without reflection,
which would make it act as if there was an infinite waveguide on the other side
into which the waves propagate indefinitely.
The way to accomplish this is to add an imaginary component to the density of
the material.
This needs to be done smoothly, otherwise the abrupt change in material
parameters would induce reflections anyway.
Therefore, the imaginary part is taken to be exponentially increasing.
Furthermore, the curve is shifted such that it starts at 0, and rescaled so that
the endpoint is at $s$.
\begin{equation}
	\rho_\text{im} = \rho_\text{si} \cdot s \cdot
	\frac{e^{-\abs{y-y_0} / d} - e^{-n/d}}{1 - e^{-n/d}}
\end{equation}
\Cref{fig:pml_profile} shows the effect of changing these parameters on the
shape of the profile of the imaginary component.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{chapters/methods/pml_profile.pdf}
	\caption{
		This figure shows the effect of changing different parameters.
		The green curves shows changing $d$ while keeping the other parameters
		fixed, and the orange and blue show $s$ and $n$ respectively.
		Darker colour means higher value, and the last green curve coincides
		with the first orange, and the last orange with the first blue.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Level-set}\label{sec:level-set}

Ultimately, we want our device to consist of regions of material and regions of
no material.
There are basically two ways of doing this.
The first, and perhaps most intuitive,
is to simply store the coordinates of the boundary between the filled and empty
regions.
In addition to storing the coordinates, one must also store which points
neighbour which.
The second method, which is the one used in this report, is called
the \emph{level-set method}.
In this method, the boundary is not directly stored, but rather is stored via an
\emph{implicit function}, $\phi(x)$, defined such that the boundary is the
0-isocontour of $\phi$.

There are two main advantages of using the level-set method rather than
directly storing the boundary points.
Firstly, when moving the boundary we would like to do so in the normal
direction, as moving it along itself has no effect.
Computing the normal direction of a directly stored boundary is slightly cumbersome,
though certainly achievable.
With level-set, moving the boundary in the normal direction is as easy as adding
a constant to the implicit function.
Secondly, while the boundary is changing the resolution in one part might need
to be increased while the resolution in another needs to be decreased. Deciding
where and when to add new points is non-trivial when directly storing the
boundary. Furthermore, if two boundaries merge, or if one splits in two, points
need to be removed and the connectivities changed, which is quite complex.
\Cref{fig:direct_troubles} illustrates these problems with direct storage concretely.
Both of these issues are automatically handled with the level-set method.
\tododec{How? (Isn't it obvious?)}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\input{chapters/methods/direct-troubles.tex}
	\caption{%
		Possible evolution of boundary. In the leftmost figure, the
		boundary is defined by pretty much evenly spaced points. In the center figure
		the boundaries have moved and the spacing is no longer even, and the
		right circle is very poorly resolved.
		The rightmost figure shows the boundary after the two circles moved
		closer together. Now there are multiple points that need to be removed,
		marked in red, and the connectivity of the points that remain must be
		changed such that the two boundaries are merged.
	}
	\label{fig:direct_troubles}
\end{figure}

There are of course a lot of possible functions $\phi(x)$ that have a given
boundary as it's 0-isocontour.
There is one choice that simplifies a lot of calculations though: the signed
distance function.
This function is defined as the distance from the closest point on the boundary,
with a plus sign if it is inside and a minus sign if it is outside the boundary.
It has the advantage that if one wishes to locally shift the boundary some
length $s$ in the normal direction, then simply add $s$ to the function there.
\Cref{fig:add_shift} shows this effect in one dimension.
\todowrt{
	Create another figure that shows it in two dimensions.
	I'm thinking a circular boundary, and adding $s$ in the left half and
	subtracting $s$ in the right half. Alternatively adding $s\cdot x$ (unit circle
	centered on 0) so that it will be smooth

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Adding $s$ to the signed distance function shifts boundary by $s$.}
	\label{fig:add_shift}
\end{figure}

As the update algorithm when optimizing level-set designs, the gradient is
simply added to the signed distance field. Some care needs to be taken in how
this is done though.
Firstly, the gradient obviously needs to be rescaled so that the boundary moves
an appropriate distance.
This has been done such that the boundary moves maximally \qty{5}{\nm}.
\todoblk[noinline]{check this number before finalizing, I change it every now and then}
Secondly, since the gradient is occasionally sharply peaked somewhere which may
not lie near the boundary, only the gradient near the boundary is actually added
to the signed distance field.
After performing this addition, what was previously a signed distance field will
now no longer be that, and thus the signed distance field is recalculated from
the new boundary.
This recalculation comes with a performance penalty, but since the COMSOL
simulations are orders of magnitude slower than all other parts of the
optimization, this is of little concern.

\section{Simulations}

\tododec{How much specifics should I have? Should I write about exporting the
	gradient to a file and how I calculate the 2D gradient in my matlab scripts
from that}
\todowrt{Mesh export / import and why that is done should probably be mentioned
since it's quite important to get the excitation in the right mode.}

\section{Optimization}

	but with sigmoid function application; sigmoid + feature size; and finally level-set.
