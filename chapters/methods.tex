\chapter{Methods}

The aim of this thesis is to use inverse design to find a phononic beamsplitter,
a task that can be divided into three parts: 
First, some definitions of what
should be designed and what constitutes a ``good'' design needs to be made.
Second, we need a way to calculate the gradient of the ``goodness'' with respect
to the design.
And lastly, we need a gradient based optimization algorithm to find the optimal
design.
All of this will be described in this chapter.

\section{Design}

The device design to be optimized can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:bs-design}

		Device design to be optimized.
		At the red line, a wave traveling right is excited.
		On the blue unit cells is where the output is measured.
		The dashed unit cells are \gls{pml}
	}

\tododec{Write about why we use the mode we use, and why I clamp the bottom. Can
reference Johan and Pauls paper}

\subsection{Level-set}

\todowrt{Description of what level-set is: A way of storing a boundary between
two regions; and how it works: Signed distance function}

\todowrt{Description of it's advantages: Easily evolved (level-set equation), no
connectivity issues, see level-set book}

\tododec{Write about how I use it? This feels like it should come after I've
talked about computing the derivative.}

\subsection{Objective function}

\tododec{Maybe I'll only mention that $f$ is an integral of the displacement
	field in the theory and here give the specific formula:
}
\begin{equation}
	\fobj = \int_{\Omega_1} \vec{m_1}^*(\vec{x}) \vec{u}(\vec{x})
	\dl{x} + \int_{\Omega_2} \vec{m_2}^*(\vec{x}) \vec{u}(\vec{x})
\end{equation}

\tododec{Paragraph about pure part of objective function, enforcing the minimum
feature size}

\section{Adjoint Simulation}

\tododec{Give the explicit formula for the gradient now that the objective
function has been fully defined}

\section{Optimization}

\tododec{Describe what optimization algorithm was used, as well as how this
	changed during the simulation. E.g.\ first 200 iterations ADAM; next ADAM
	but with sigmoid function application; sigmoid + feature size; and finally level-set.
